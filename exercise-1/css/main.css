/* Assign Styles here */

As described in [module-4](https://github.com/info343c-a16/m4-git-intro), start by forking and cloning this repository. If you're feeling ambitious, I suggest you try to mimic the rendering _without_ the following instructions. The HTML elements are already in place, so you'll apply the following styles in your `css/main.css` file:

Apply the following styles to the container element of your name tag:
- Assign a `width` of `400px`
- Assign a `height` of `200px`
- Make the text centered by assigning the appropriate value to the `text-align` property
- Give it a border that is 1px solid red
- Make a thick red bottom border of 20px
- Give the container rounded edges by setting the `border-radius` property to 10px

Give the top section of your name tag the following styles:
- The font-family should be sans-serif
- The bottom borer should be 1px solid black
- To set the text color, assign the `color` property a value of `white`
- Round the top-left and top-right borders to match the container styles

Select all top-level headers and assign the following styles:
- Set the top and bottom margins to 0px
- Set a font-size 3 times the root element's font-size
- To achieve the font appearance, you'll need to set a font-weight of 100, and a font-variant of small-caps

Assign the following styles to second-level headers:
- Set a margin-top of 1px, and a margin-bottom of 3px
- Achieve the font look by setting the font-style to `italic` and the font-size to .8rem

Assign a color of `red` to all elements with class `red`.

Manipulate the _name_ area by assigning these styles:
- Set the font-size to `3rem`
- Set the font-family to `fantasy`
- Assign a margin of 25px
